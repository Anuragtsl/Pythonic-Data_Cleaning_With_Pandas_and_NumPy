# Pythonic-Data_Cleaning_With_Pandas_and_NumPy

I have done Data Cleaning on three different datasets.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Pandas and NumPy libraries to clean data.

I've used Jupyter Notebook {https://jupyter.org/} for coding!

You can follow along the Jupyter Notebook.

* Changing the Index of a DataFrame
* Tidying up Fields in the Data
* Combining str Methods with NumPy to Clean Columns
* Cleaning the Entire Dataset Using the applymap Function
* Renaming Columns and Skipping Rows

# Python Data Cleaning: Recap and Resources

I've learned how you can drop unnecessary information from a dataset using the drop() function,
as well as how to set an index for your dataset so that items in it can be referenced easily.

Moreover, I learned how to clean object fields with the .str() accessor and how to clean the entire dataset using the applymap() method.

Lastly, I explored how to skip rows in a CSV file and rename columns using the rename() method.

Knowing about data cleaning is very important, because it is a big part of data science.
